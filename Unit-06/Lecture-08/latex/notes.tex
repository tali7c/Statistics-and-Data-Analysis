\begin{document}
\maketitle

\section*{Topic}
Time-series diagnostics and SARIMA seasonal modeling (overview).

\subsection*{Learning Outcomes}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Explain why diagnostics are needed after fitting
  \item Recognize residual autocorrelation as model issue
  \item Explain SARIMA seasonal terms at a high level
  \item Choose seasonal period s (weekly/monthly/yearly)
\end{itemize}

\section*{Detailed Notes}
These notes are designed to be read alongside the slides. They expand each slide bullet into
plain-language explanations, small worked examples, and common pitfalls. When a formula
appears, emphasize (1) what each symbol means, (2) the assumptions needed to use it, and (3)
how to interpret the final number in the problem context.

\section*{Diagnostics}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Residuals should look like white noise
  \item Check residual ACF
  \item Check stability of variance
\end{itemize}

\section*{SARIMA}
\begin{itemize}
  \item ARIMA(p,d,q) x (P,D,Q,s)
  \item Seasonal differencing D
  \item s is the seasonal period
\end{itemize}

\section*{Exercises (with Solutions)}
\subsection*{Exercise 1: Residual goal}
After fitting, what should residuals look like ideally?
\subsection*{Solution}
\begin{itemize}
  \item White noise: no pattern, no autocorrelation.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Exercise 2: Seasonal period}
Daily data with weekly seasonality: what is s?
\subsection*{Solution}
\begin{itemize}
  \item s=7
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Exercise 3: Why seasonal}
Why add seasonal terms?
\subsection*{Solution}
\begin{itemize}
  \item To capture repeating seasonal dependence.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Exit Question}
What is one residual symptom that suggests your model is inadequate?
